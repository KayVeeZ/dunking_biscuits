# Biscuit Classifier

Welcome to the Biscuit Classifier repository! This project aims to classify different types of biscuits using machine learning algorithms based on certain parameters.
Introduction

In this project, we use machine learning techniques to build a classifier that can predict the type of biscuit based on features such as gamma, phi, eta, L, and t.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Clone the repository:</li>

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/biscuit-classifier.git
   ```

<li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>

   ```bash
   cd biscuit-classifier
   ```

<li>Install the required dependencies:</li>

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
</ol>

## Usage

<ol>
<li>Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Biscuit_Classifier.ipynb`:</li>

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Biscuit_Classifier.ipynb
   ```

<li>Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the classifier.</li>
</ol>
